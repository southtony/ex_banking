# ExBanking

Users and operations.
Every user in the system is a two-spawned process that keeps connected.

The PendingOperationServer is a process that saves an operation that should be executed in its state. This state is a queue implementation.

The UserServer is a process that saves a user's balance in its state and it has callback functions to update it.

Example: Three users in the ExBanking system
